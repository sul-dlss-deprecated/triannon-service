## Triannon-Service

An essentially empty Rails app used for deploying the triannon gem.  Triannon stores OpenAnnotation data in Fedora4.

# Client Interactions with Triannon app

### Get a list of annos
GET: http://(host)/
GET: http://(host)/annotations

### Get a particular anno
GET: http://(host)/annotations/(anno_id)
* use HTTP Accept header with mime type to indicate desired format
** default:  jsonld
** also supports turtle, rdfxml, html
** see https://github.com/sul-dlss/triannon/blob/master/app/controllers/triannon/annotations_controller.rb #show method for mime formats accepted

#### JSON-LD context
You can request IIIF or OA context for jsonld.  You can use either of these methods (with the correct HTTP Accept header):

GET: http://(host)/annotations/iiif/(anno_id)
GET: http://(host)/annotations/(anno_id)?jsonld_context=iiif

GET: http://(host)/annotations/oa/(anno_id)
GET: http://(host)/annotations/(anno_id)?jsonld_context=oa

Note that OA (Open Annotation) is the default context if none is specified.

### Create an anno
POST: http://(host)/annotations
* the body of the HTTP request should contain the annotation, as jsonld, turtle, or rdfxml
* the anno to be created should NOT already have an assigned @id

### Delete an anno
DELETE: http://(host)/annotations/(anno_id)
